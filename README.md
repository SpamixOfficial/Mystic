# Mystic Project


# Goal:
I plan to make a modular bot interface, 1 bot for 1 purpose, this is because
statistically members prefer MORE bots then less, it diversifies / commands, and makse it 
more over easier, So right now I am working on the dashboard pages for Mystic Levels and Mystic Welcomer,
With plenty more to come
